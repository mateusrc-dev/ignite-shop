Ignite-Shop App - Rocketseat's Ignite course challenge

Application is a t-shirt store created in nextJs

In this application we create static pages using functions like getStaticProps and getServerSideProps to run code on the server side

We use the stripe API to place the products and pick up those products

The checkout is completed in Stripe, when completing the purchase the page is redirected to our application

Hooks such as useState, useEffect and useContext were used to create the logic of the application carts
